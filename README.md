This repository hosts the code for the BST 260 final project for Ninon Becquart, Gabrielle LaRosa, Alana McGovern, and Rebecca Youngerman.

Note that each shiny app and analysis (from each of the four group members) are in their own folders within the 'analyses' folder. This is for clarity of which 'app.R' is connected to each analysis.
